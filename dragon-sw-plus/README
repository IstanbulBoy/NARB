The DRAGON GMPLS software suite is free software that combines an
open-source routing package with an open-source signaling package and
extends both to support GMPLS routing and signaling.

This (dragon-sw-plus) package contains supplemental modules to the 
DRAGON GMPLS software suite (dragon-sw), including the Network-Aware 
Resource Broker (NARB) and the Resource Computation Engine (RCE). 
RCE is needed for NARB to function completely. They are both becoming
integrative components of the DRAGON GMPLS software suite. NARB and 
RCE are developed independent of any other existing code except that
they both support the GNU zebra OSPF API client interface.
