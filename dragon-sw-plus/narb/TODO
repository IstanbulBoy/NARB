	LSAHandler, XMLHandler, ...

2. Indexing classes

--------------------
a. inject inter-domain LSA's from NARB
b. dump/show all the LSA's 
c. create CSPF class
	c.1. Filter list
	c.2. Function & data structures to apply filters
	c.3. Toplogy generation
	c.4. Virtual PathComputation Algorithm
	c.5. Vitual topology reduction function or Additional filter
--------------------

6. OSPFAPI Handler/OSPFReader ... (OSPF_APIClient)
	Suck LSDB directly from OSPFd's

7. Event interuption/checkpoint scheduling technique?
	For heavy-task event. Write a sequence of section-funcions
	The Event will keep the execution states. EventMaster will 
	re-queue it after the next (or next two) events. Run() will
	resume the execution to the next sectioned/sub-function in order.
	(insert after the first event that has fewer sections executed
	or insert after the least executed ones in the next three~five)
